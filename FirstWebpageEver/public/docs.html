            Classes play a strict role within the Shadawi Universe, you can think of this as the ranking or 
            hierarchy between specimens. In some rare cases, Shadawi may unite with their lower-class members 
            and become a product of both classes. Each class deals +15% more damage to the lower class member.

            There are 3 different types of abilities a conditional, alter,  and 
            strike. A specimen can have all three of these abilities or just one,
            but never will a specimen have no ability.

            <div class="values">
            Conditional: if a certain condition is true within that battle. Specimen will activate an alter, 
            which can change stats or gameplay.<br><br>
    
            Alter: an alter is a type of ability that can change enemy or player stats, or gameplay. <br><br>

            Strike: is the basic attack that will activate every “attack time”. Also a strike usually  
            comes with modifiers that may alter these battle stats: atk, def, tme, stn, ago, pow. <br><br>

            There are 4 different kinds of Shadawi.

            <div class="values">

            BASE:<br>
            base-type specimen, are the Shadawi standard specimen. Base specimen usually carry only 1 
            form However periodically we may add or remove skins to it's base form.<br><br>
            
    
            COLORS: <br>
            Color-type specimen are a distinct force in the shadawi universe, each  form is a different 
            variant of that specimen. These specimen only have 1 skin per form, however they may have 
            different characteristics & abilities from their other variants, unlike base.<br><br>
            

            EVO: <br>
            an Evo-type specimen can evolve over time. A specimen's evolution time depends on its species.
            The longest recorded time for a specimen to achieve its final form is 3 years, but you can 
            speed up the process by feeding it gems. The higher the Purg level the more powerful the 
            gems are.<br><br>

            FUSION: <br>
            a fusion type specimen is a uniqe specimen that requires each form to be fused to create the final specimen. 
            Each form within a fusion type is called a "component". In the fusion process, the owner needs to have all 
            components of that specimen/SID to complete the fuse. No gems are required. <br><br>

                "mighty" purg level will always be harder to obtain than a "weak"
